sat_data basic programs

data.py downloads data files from the NASA repository, creates dataframes, and saves the dataframe as .pkl files
A new folder is created called "data" containing all of these files

data_plot.py creates plots from the .pkl files created by data.py
Dataframes are read and plotted for both magnetic field and position data in cartesian and polar coordinates vs. time

main.py runs neural network (both with 3 outputs and 1 output) and linear regression techniques to train and test on the .pkl files while removing one parameter in each iteration.
File patterns can be designated as well as number of epochs and samples used.
main_results contains subdirectories for each of the desired satellites containing a .md file with a results summary and .dat files containing the full results dataframes with the parameter after the underscore indicating the removed parameter or that it uses all parameters (e.g. results_all.dat, results_r.dat)
.pkl files of errors are also created for easier plotting.

main_plot.py creates error plots from the .pkl files generated by main.py.
main_plots contains subdirectories for each sattelite pattern with these plots.
